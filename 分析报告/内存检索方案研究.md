# Mind-OS Memory & Retrieval Research Report

I have investigated current open-source projects on GitHub and identified three main paradigms that fit the Mind-OS philosophy:

## 1. Top Candidates for Integration

| Project | Primary Strength | Mind-OS Application | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LlamaIndex** | **Data Connector/RAG** | The gold standard for indexing Markdown folders. Highly customizable. | **Primary Choice** for local note retrieval. |
| **Mem0** | **Personalized Layer** | Remembers "User Preferences" across sessions beyond just files. | **Secondary Choice** for personality tracking. |
| **Cognee** | **Semantic Graphs** | Builds a "Knowledge Graph" of your brain. | **Experimental** for high-complexity insight mapping. |

## 2. Recommended Architecture for Mind-OS

To maintain your privacy and local-first control, I recommend the following "Lightweight RAG" setup:

- **Foundation**: Use **LlamaIndex (Local)** as the engine.
- **Storage**: Use **ChromaDB** or **FAISS** (Local vector stores) so no data leaves your machine.
- **Parser**: Use `SimpleDirectoryReader` to automatically watch and index your `知识画像/`, `深度觉察/`, etc.
- **Interface**: Integrate a `search` command into `mind-os.py` that hits this local index.

## 3. Why LlamaIndex?

- **Native Markdown Support**: It handles metadata, headers, and frontmatter very well.
- **Low Friction**: We can run it entirely on your laptop without an enterprise server.
- **Agentic Ready**: It's designed to let AIs "decide" which tool to use (Memory retrieval vs. Web search).

## ⏭️ Proposed Next Steps

I will update the **Memory & Retrieval** phase in the implementation plan to use this **Local-LlamaIndex** architecture. This will transform Mind-OS from a "Searchable Folder" into a "Living Brain" that the AI can query in milliseconds.
